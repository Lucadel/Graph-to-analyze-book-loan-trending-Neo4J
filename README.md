# Graph-to-analyze-book-loan-trending-Neo4J
A UTT project related to Neo4J graph database. 
I choose to study a book loan database in order to explore people's interest in reading.
This project includes:
- Data preprocessing in Python
- Data visualization in Python
- Web scrapping via Googlebook API in Python
- A synthesis with the Neo4J queries made on the graph database to extract valuable information
